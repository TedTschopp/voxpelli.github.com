  <h2>Offline ðŸ˜¢</h2>
  <p>Unfortunately we're currently offline. I would happily say that I'm the problem and not you, but could it perhaps be that you suddenly walked out of internet coverage? Please let it be so.</p>
  <p>If it after all isn't you but indeed is me â€“ then I've probably had a pretty critical hosting issue over here and if that's so: I'm very very sorry ðŸ˜­ Please do share your desperation with me over on Twitter, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/voxpelli">@voxpelli</a> there.</p>
