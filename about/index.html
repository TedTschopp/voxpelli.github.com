  <h2>About me and this site</h2>
  <p>Hi, my name is <strong class="p-name fn">Pelle Wessman</strong>, but people might know me as <strong class="p-nickname nickname">VoxPelli</strong> on the web. I'm living in <span class="h-adr adr"><strong class="p-locality locality">Malmö</strong> in southern <strong class="p-country-name country-name">Sweden</strong></span>, just besides the danish capital of Copenhagen, where I'm working as a <span class="p-job-title title">web developer</span> at <a href="http://hdsydsvenskan.se/">HD-Sydsvenskan</a> – building the  <a href="https://www.sydsvenskan.se/">Sydsvenskan.se</a> and <a href="https://www.hd.se/">HD.se</a> sites.</p>
  <p>Previously I've worked at blog reader startup <a href="http://www.bloglovin.com/">Bloglovin</a>, experienced life as a consultant through <a href="https://valtech.se/">Valtech Sweden</a>, taken part of the team behind micro-payment startup <a href="http://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> and grown up as a web developer in the arms of former Malmö web agency Good Old. Before and inbetween all of that there's also been some freelancing, philosophy studies, psychology studies, non-profit work etc. – just to spice things up a bit.</p>
  <p>As a web developer I've done tons of things – started out with vanilla PHP at the back-end, went on to WordPress and Drupal and then finally Node.js took over. At the front-end I started out deploying IE6 hasLayout fixes and now it's all flexboxes, Service Workers and the rest of the amazing features that the modern web brings.</p>
  <p>During most of my professional journey I've had the opportunity to contribute back to the <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/voxpelli">open source community</a> and I've especially been doing so to the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/User:Kodfabrik.se" rel="me">IndieWeb</a>, <a href="https://npmjs.org/~voxpelli" rel="me">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/voxpelli" rel="me">Drupal</a> ones. I've done everything from finding issues and posting bug reports to constructing patches and launching new projects – both by myself and together with colleagues.</p>
