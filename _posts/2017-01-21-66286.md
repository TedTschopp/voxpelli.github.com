Just launched a ServiceWorker here on my site, added a manifest.json that for now goes all in on setting it up for a PWA (it shouldn&#39;t really configure itself to launch as a standalone app, but I want to test the standalone mode out so for now it will) and modified the published time on all of these posts to by default be set as 15 seconds old and thus never be treated as a future post when the build server is triggered by a Micropub post â€“ something both GitHub pages and Netlify has had a problem with.
