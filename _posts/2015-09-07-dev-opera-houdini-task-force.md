> Its primary aim isn’t to give us “new CSS” but to add API hooks into the browsers’ built-in CSS capability so developers can hook into it, use the native implementation where we want (rather than duplicate it) and extend it. It’s applying the Extensible Web Manifesto’s philosophy to CSS.

This sounds very promising. Making it possible to extend CSS better and easier will help iteration and adoption of new techniques and bring it to the level that some JavaScript polyfills are at today. A promising future for the extensible web.
