This bus experiment from Citymapper feels so much more relevant to me than anything Uber has done.

In cities that have been built for humans – where you can walk, ride a bike, take a bus, subway, train etc – this makes so much more sense.

Uber feels like the solution for cities where cars are the focus. Citymapper feels like the solution for cities where people are the focus.

Is this the European take on solving modern transportation?
