Not sure if there&#39;s any examples of people who have done this yet, but classicly one can use rel-next and rel-prev to indicate pagination, feels like that could make sense to use here as well, at least in addition to whatever other solution one comes up with.

One of the reasons why there probably aren&#39;t a lot of examples on how to do this is that until more people use IndieReaders it can easily be a case of plumbing rather than dogfooding as one will be marking up stuff that no one yet uses. So first step towards solving this is to dogfood it with an IndieReader.
