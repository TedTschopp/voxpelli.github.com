Just released version 0.3.0 of my self-hosteable micropub endpoint for Jekyll sites: https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-micropub-to-github/releases/tag/v0.3.0

What&#39;s new? It now supports configurable permalink styles – whatever Jekyll supports it supports – Jekylls code has been ported over and so has Jekylls own tests.

How do I use it? Update your code. Done. The other new feature is auto-configuration, which reads your Jekyll configuration to figure out what your permalink style is.
