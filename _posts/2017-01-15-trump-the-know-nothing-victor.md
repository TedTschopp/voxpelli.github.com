> There is a problem in journalism that we favour lots of diversities over economic diversity … We don’t have enough folks who grew up in working-class rural communities.

This is probably true for many places that want to be actively working towards gathering a more diverse crowd. When measuring the diversity one picks a few dimensions, but forgets that there are many others as well. The diverse crowd one then gathers might only be diverse in some very specific ways, but far from diverse in other ones. The diverse city crowd is eg. still a city crowd and might differ from the diverse non-city crowd.
