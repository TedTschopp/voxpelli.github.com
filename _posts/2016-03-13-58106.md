I think relying on rel-webmention is the right thing to do long term. If one advertises that one accepts mentions, but still doesn&#39;t do it, then something is wrong and since it&#39;s still early on we should try to fix the cases where rel-webmention is advertised wrongly rather than try to build workarounds. If we are to build workarounds, then we should first document why rel-webmention doesn&#39;t work and why we can&#39;t fix it so that it works.

+1 on bringing it up!

(I hope to contribute by making it very easy to set up such a mechanism using my Webmention endpoint. I have one set up at http://voxpelli.com/mentions/)
