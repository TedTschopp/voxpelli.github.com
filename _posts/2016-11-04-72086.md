Yarn certainly helps with some parts of this. Eg. parts of &quot;installed-check&quot; can be replaced with &quot;yarn check&quot;, but the engine checks, &quot;dependency-check&quot; and &quot;husky&quot; certainly still provide value when using Yarn.

The ecosystem is to a large degree still the same, no matter if one uses the Yarn client or the npm client.
