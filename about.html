  <h2>About me and this site</h2>
  <p>So, my name is Pelle Wessman, but people might know me as VoxPelli on the web. I'm a swedish guy that currently lives in Malmö in southern Sweden, less than half an hour away from the danish capital of Copenhagen. I was born in this area and over twenty years later I'm still around - how nice/awful.</p>
  <p>Since the autumn of 2010 I've been working on the micro-payment startup Flattr - first part time but in the spring of 2011 I quit my job at the web agency Good Old to go almost full time at Flattr. I work as a web developer, focusing on the frontend parts.</p>
