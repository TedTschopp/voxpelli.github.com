  <h2>About me and this site</h2>
  <p>So, my name is <strong class="p-name fn">Pelle Wessman</strong>, but people might know me as <strong class="p-nickname nickname">VoxPelli</strong> on the web. I'm living in <span class="h-adr adr"><strong class="p-locality locality">Malmö</strong> in southern <strong class="p-country-name country-name">Sweden</strong></span>, just besides the danish capital of Copenhagen.</p>
  <p>I'm working as a <span class="p-job-title title">web developer</span> on blog reader startup <a href="http://www.bloglovin.com/" class="p-org org">Bloglovin</a>.</p>
  <p>Prior to that I worked as a consultant for <a href="https://valtech.se/">Valtech Sweden</a>, took part of the team behind micro-payment startup <a href="http://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> and grew up as a web developer in the arms of the Malmö web agency <a href="http://goodold.se/">Good Old</a>. And before and inbetween all of that there's been some philosophy studies, freelancing, non-profiting etc. – just to spice things up a bit.</p>
  <p>As a web developer I've done tons of things – started out with vanilla PHP, went on to <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and then <a href="https://npmjs.org/~voxpelli" rel="me">Node.js</a> took over – and then there's the frontend stuff as well! During my entire journey time I've got the opportunity to contribute back to both the <a href="http://drupal.org/user/341713" rel="me">Drupal community</a> and the <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/voxpelli">open source community</a> in general (and the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/User:Kodfabrik.se" rel="me">IndieWeb one</a> in particular) - posting issues, patches and me and my colleagues own projects.</p>
