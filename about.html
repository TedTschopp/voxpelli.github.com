  <h2>About me and this site</h2>
  <p>So, my name is <strong class="fn">Pelle Wessman</strong>, but people might know me as <strong class="nickname">VoxPelli</strong> on the web. I'm a swedish guy that currently lives in <span class="adr"><strong class="locality">Malmö</strong> in southern <strong class="country-name">Sweden</strong></span>, less than half an hour away from the danish capital of Copenhagen.</p>
  <p>Since the autumn of 2010 I've been working on the micro-payment startup <a href="http://flattr.com/" class="org">Flattr</a> - first part time but in the spring of 2011 I quit my old job at the web agency <a href="http://goodold.se/">Good Old</a> to go almost full time at Flattr. I work there as a <span class="title">web developer</span>, focusing mostly on the frontend parts.</p>
  <p>During my time at Good Old I was part of building many <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> sites - both large and small. I also got the opportunity to <a href="http://drupal.org/user/341713" rel="me">contribute back</a> to the Drupal community - posting issues, patches and our own modules. Those projects are stille alive, but I'm no longer a very active contributor to the Drupal community.</p>
  <p>Prior to working at Good Old I was freelancing as a web developer from my home town Eslöv, helping designers turn their ideas into real web sites. During this time I was also active in a local concert organizer, "Alive", together with other youths - organizing among other things a one day festival, "Festival 0413", for three years in a row. One year even with a €10k grant from EU - which was quite a bureaucratic experience as I was organization's accounter at the time.</p>
